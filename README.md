This is a basic Movie app created with like 10 movies of data feeded in 
In this what I have learned is :
     1. ListView
     2.ClipRRect
     3. How to work with diff stateless widgets and joining them together
     4. Card
     5. Gradient 
     6. Route
     7.Stacking over 2-3 widgets and many more
     
In this what you will see is a basic app in which on the front screen you will see the list of movies with their details on the side and a small image of their poster.
When you click on any of those images it will take you to their page where you can see the images both on the top and many more images on the bottom which you can scroll sideways
